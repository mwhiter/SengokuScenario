			<Text>The term "Yari Ashigaru" refers to foot soldiers armed with the yari, a long spear that became their signature weapon. The yari, typically measuring around six to twelve feet in length, provided reach and versatility in combat. The Ashigaru were trained in the art of yarijutsu, spear techniques that emphasized precision strikes and coordination within their ranks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Initially, the Yari Ashigaru were primarily peasants and commoners who were conscripted or enlisted to serve in the armies of daimyo. These foot soldiers provided a means for daimyo to field large armies at a relatively low cost, as the Ashigaru were less expensive to equip and maintain than the samurai warriors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over time, the Yari Ashigaru gained recognition for their discipline, effectiveness, and adaptability on the battlefield. They were known for their ability to form tight spear formations, called "yari wall" or "spear hedge," which created a formidable barrier against cavalry charges and infantry assaults.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Yari Ashigaru were also skilled in siege warfare, often wielding their spears as makeshift pikes to repel castle defenders or breach enemy fortifications. They were adept at employing tactical formations, such as the "crane wing" or "flying geese," to encircle and overwhelm enemy forces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The prominence of the Yari Ashigaru reached its peak during the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. Led by Oda Nobunaga and his strategist, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a combined force of Ashigaru and matchlock gunners successfully defended against the cavalry charges of the Takeda clan. The battle showcased the effectiveness of the Ashigaru's disciplined formations and their integration with firearms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the Sengoku Jidai period came to a close and the Tokugawa shogunate was established, the role of the Yari Ashigaru underwent significant changes. With the Tokugawa shoguns seeking to stabilize Japan and establish a strict social hierarchy, the Ashigaru became more regulated and their status became more defined. They were often assigned to specific domains, serving as part of the standing armies under the control of the daimyo.</Text>

			<Text>Horse archery, known as "yabusame" or "inuoumono" in feudal Japan, was a skillful and revered martial art practiced by elite warriors called "samurai." This ancient tradition originated from continental Asia, and the Japanese adopted and refined it to suit their unique combat style. Horse archers were highly regarded for their exceptional horsemanship and marksmanship, capable of firing arrows with remarkable precision while riding at high speeds. The bow they used was called a "yumi," which was longer than the traditional bows used by infantry, allowing for greater accuracy and range. These skilled horse archers played a pivotal role in battles, skirmishes, and hunting expeditions, showcasing their deadly proficiency in both open field engagements and guerrilla warfare.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout Japan's feudal period, horse archers served as essential components of samurai armies, particularly during the Sengoku (Warring States) period from the 15th to 17th centuries. They were valued for their mobility, enabling them to perform hit-and-run tactics, surprise attacks, and encircle enemies. Their strategic significance in conflicts led to extensive training, and some domains even held yabusame competitions to foster and demonstrate the mastery of this art. Although the advent of firearms and the centralization of power under the Tokugawa shogunate brought changes to warfare, the legacy of horse archers endured, exemplifying their lasting impact on Japan's military history.</Text>

However, boarding actions were the most important tactic of war at sea, and everything else was subordinated to them. This was just as well, as incendiary weapons lacked the power of cannons, which were hardly common.

Siege ladders were typically long, portable wooden structures with rungs or steps that could be propped against the walls to allow warriors to climb and enter the city. These ladders were often accompanied by other siege weapons, such as battering rams or catapults, to weaken the defenses and create openings for the attacking forces.
